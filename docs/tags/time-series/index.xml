      <description>Last [Algorithm Breakdown](https://www.ritchievink.com/blog/2018/09/26/algorithm-breakdown-ar-ma-and-arima-models/) we build an ARIMA model from scratch and discussed the use cases of that kind of models. ARIMA models are great when you have got stationary data and when you want to predict a few time steps into the future. A lot of business data, being generated by human processes, have got weekly and yearly seasonalities (we for instance, seem work to less in weekends and holidays) and show peaks at certain events.</description>

      <description>Time series are a quite unique topic within machine learning. In a lot of problems the dependent variable $y$, i.e. the thing we want to predict is dependent on very clear inputs, such as pixels of an image, words in a sentence, the properties of a persons buying behavior, etc. In time series these indepent variables are often not known. For instance, in stock markets, we don&amp;rsquo;t have a clear independent set of variables where we can fit a model on.</description>
